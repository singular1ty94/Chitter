#Chitter

A CherryPy Twitter Search and Analyzer by singular1ty94 and k9chan.

#Install

You'll need to run `pip install cherrypy`, `pip install nltk` and `pip install twython`

Sometimes you'll run into issues with Tweepy, you *must* use **Python 2.x**, and if you receive odd messages about modules not importing, you might be forced to do a clean install.

#Running

Just run `python chitter.py` and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
