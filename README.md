#Chitter

A CherryPy Twitter Stream by singular1ty94.

#Install

You'll need to run `pip install cherrypy` and `pip install tweepy`.

Sometimes you'll run into issues with Tweepy, you *must* use **Python 2.x**, and if you receive odd messages about modules not importing, you might be forced to do a clean install.

#Running

Just run `python chitter.py`
